## Purpose

ItemzAPP is developed with focus on ease of defining, maintaining, sharing and reporting on different types of Itemz.

Itemz could be anything like

- Contract Document
- Needs and Wants Specification
- List of Activities
- Standard Specification
- Journal on Specific Topic
- Rule Book
- Cook Book
- Nicely described Life Memories in a Specific Order (Personal Notes)
- Research Report on specific topics (people collecting common findings on COVID-19 - Coronavirus)

BUT primarily, Itemz is nothing but Requirements / Needs / Wants.
