Main purpose of this project is to help users and teams to **`do it right`** and ultimately **`reduce waste of effort`**.

Currently we are capturing  requirements for this project as Markdown files within this same repository. You can find them under [Docs and Notes](https://github.com/Dharmesh-Shah/ItemzAPI/tree/master/ItemzAPI/01%20Docs%20and%20Notes). 

Soon, we will start posting current challenges that we are working on. Your contributions as well as direction / support from community is much appreciated.

## Purpose

ItemzAPP is developed with focus on ease of defining, maintaining, sharing and reporting on different types of Itemz.

Itemz could be anything like

- Contract Document
- Needs and Wants Specification
- List of Activities
- Standard Specification
- Journal on Specific Topic
- Rule Book
- Cook Book
- Nicely described Life Memories in a Specific Order (Personal Notes)
- Research Report on specific topics (people collecting common findings on COVID-19 - Coronavirus)

BUT primarily, Itemz is nothing but Requirements / Needs / Wants.

## Overview of Current State

We are in the process of defining Web APIs for Itemz Application. This Web APIs are mainly considered as server side programming that covers API and Repository  Database development.

Following are the key areas that we are working on for now...

- ASP .NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core as ORM tool.
- SQL Server as Database
- Postman for writing tests and simulate Web API with.

## Feature we are developing

Implement [Concept of Versioning Itemz](https://github.com/Dharmesh-Shah/ItemzAPI/blob/master/ItemzAPI/01%20Docs%20and%20Notes/Concept-Of-Versioning-Itemz/Concept-Of-Versioning-Itemz.md)

We have already implemented Individual Itemz SQUASH feature. 

Next we are working on support for SQUASH at Requirements Type level.
